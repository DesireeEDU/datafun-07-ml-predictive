Linear Regression

## Task 1
Read and work through Chapter 10 - Object-Oriented Programming - and understand the examples. 

## Task 2
Read and work through Chapter 15 - Machine Learning - and understand the examples. 

## Task 3 (from 10.16 above)
Follow the process provided in the text. 

In the same notebook, continue with 15.4 (staring page 620). 
This time, we'll use scikit-learn estimator, and we'll practice splitting data for training (to build a model) and testing (testing our model against known values). 
Follow the instructions all the way though charting it again with the specified axes.

At the end of your notebook add some remarks comparing the two methods.
